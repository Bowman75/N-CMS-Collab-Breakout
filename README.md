# NCMS Collaboration & Trust Breakout

An interactive, self-contained breakout activity for PLCs on building collaboration and trust.

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repo (public recommended), then upload this whole folder.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** and **/** (root)
3. Open your Pages URL (e.g., `https://<yourname>.github.io/<repo>/`).

## Use locally
- Keep the `assets` folder next to `index.html`.
- Double click `index.html` to run it in a browser.

## What’s inside
- `index.html` — the activity with 3 puzzles, auto-checking, reset buttons, and a final lock.
- `assets/` — audio, video, and reference PDFs.

## Notes
- Puzzles unlock after both media play for 30 seconds.
- Wrong answers highlight in red; use reset to try again.
